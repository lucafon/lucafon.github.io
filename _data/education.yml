    <mark>Thesis</mark> A Machine Learning project based on arm gesture recognition and humanoid imitation. Arm gestures are acquired by inertial motion sensors and modelled in an OpenGL 3D virtual space. A new method based on Functional Principal Component Analysis is used in MATLAB for both a supervised clustering of training data and gesture recognition. Recognized gestures are imitated by a small humanoid robot
